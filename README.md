# Pong project using Processing

This is a Pong project that has been developed using Processing software. It was made for a subject of my degree.

## How to play

In order to play you will need to:

* Install Processing from the official website.
* Install the "Sound" library of Processing.
* Know the controls  (Player 1 => \<w\> and \<s\>) (Player 2 => \<up\> and <down\>).

## Way of work

In order to develop a better code "Clean code" rules have been applied using descriptive functions and variables avoiding the overuse of comments.
